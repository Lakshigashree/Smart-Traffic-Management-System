# 🚦 Smart Traffic Management System (STMS)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Smart Traffic Management System (STMS)** is a modern, AI-driven traffic control solution designed to improve urban mobility, reduce congestion, and support emergency response systems.  

This repository currently contains a **UI/UX prototype designed using Figma**, showcasing the conceptual design, navigation flow, and core features of a smart city traffic management platform.

The project is suitable for **academic use, hackathons, smart city initiatives, and as a foundation for future full-stack and AI-based implementation**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Prototype
- To present a **professional and scalable UI/UX design** for a smart traffic system  
- To validate feature flow and system navigation before development  
- To act as a base for future **AI, ML, IoT, and full-stack development**
