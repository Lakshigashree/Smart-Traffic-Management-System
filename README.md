# 🚦 Smart Traffic Management System (STMS)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Smart Traffic Management System (STMS)** is a modern, AI-driven traffic control solution designed to enhance urban mobility, reduce traffic congestion, and improve emergency response efficiency.

This repository currently contains a **UI/UX prototype** created using **Figma**, representing the conceptual design, navigation flow, and core modules of a smart city traffic management platform.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Prototype
- To present a **professional and scalable UI/UX design** for a smart traffic system  
- To validate **feature flow, usability, and system navigation** before implementation  
- To serve as a **foundation for future AI, ML, IoT, and full-stack development**
