# 🚦 Smart Traffic Management System (STMS)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Smart Traffic Management System (STMS)** is a modern, AI-driven traffic control solution designed to enhance urban mobility, reduce traffic congestion, and improve emergency response efficiency.

This repository currently contains a **UI/UX prototype** created using **Figma**, representing the conceptual design, navigation flow, and core modules of a smart city traffic management platform.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Prototype
- To present a **professional and scalable UI/UX design** for a smart traffic system  
- To validate **feature flow, usability, and system navigation** before implementation  
- To serve as a **foundation for future AI, ML, IoT, and full-stack development**

- Displays traffic status, congestion levels, alerts, and signal health  
- Designed for real-time monitoring and administrative control  

#### 2️⃣ Live Traffic Map
- Real-time visualization of city-wide traffic flow  
- Interactive map showing congestion density and vehicle movement  
- Designed for future integration with live camera feeds and AI models  

#### 3️⃣ Traffic Signals
- Monitoring and management of automated traffic signals  
- Signal status display (Red / Yellow / Green)  
- Scope for AI-based adaptive signal control  

#### 4️⃣ Emergency Vehicles
- Priority routing for ambulances, fire trucks, and police vehicles  
- Live tracking and route optimization  
- Supports creation of green corridors during emergencies  

#### 5️⃣ Alerts
- Real-time notifications for:
  - Accidents  
  - Traffic congestion  
  - Signal malfunctions  
  - System anomalies  
- Visual alert indicators for rapid response  

#### 6️⃣ Analytics

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Figma** – UI/UX Design & Interactive Prototyping  

---

## 📂 Design and Prototyping
✅ This Figma UI Design was created using Figma's built-in AI assist tools.
✅ All design decisions (layout, hierarchy, component logic, color scheme, interactions) were reviewed and finalized manually by our team to ensure clarity and UX quality.

## 📂 Details:
- AI was used to generate a first draft of the dashboard layout.
- Team refined spacing, hierarchy, and component behaviour.
- All interactions and flows were designed and validated by the team.
- This design reflects our UI/UX thinking and supports the MVP experience. 

🚧 **Development In Progress**

### Planned Future Development
- **Frontend:** React / Next.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js / Python  
- **AI/ML:** Vehicle detection, congestion prediction & traffic optimization  
- **Database & APIs:** Real-time data handling  
- **IoT Integration:** Live camera feeds & smart sensors  

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- AI-based vehicle detection using CCTV feeds  
- Reinforcement Learning for adaptive traffic signal control  
- Real-time emergency route optimization  
- Mobile application for traffic authorities  
- Public traffic analytics dashboard  
- Smart city infrastructure integration
